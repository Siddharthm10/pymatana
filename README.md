Python-based analysis tools for imaging system response matrix analysis.

## PPDF Analysis

[ppdf-analysis](ppdf-analysis) folder

### Analysis of Angular Sampling Completeness Index (ASCI) Maps Analysis

[ppdf-analysis/asci-map-analysis/](ppdf-analysis/asci-map-analysis/) folder

- The `asci-map-analysis` folder contains the code used to generate the ASCI maps in the 2025 SNMMI abstract submission **_"Angular sampling completeness index and width of projection probability density function strips as spatial resolution metrics in self-collimation single photon emission tomography"_**.
- Follow the instructions in the [README](ppdf-analysis/asci-map-analysis/README.md) to run the scripts.
